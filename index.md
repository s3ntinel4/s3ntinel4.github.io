## About Me

Hi, my name is Carlos Henrique, a cybersecurity student with experience in **helpdesk**, **network troubleshooting** and **customer support**, i fell in love with cybersecurity few years ago since then i began my journey with focus in blue team and cloud security.

> Is all about consistency ...


## Projects

#### [Python Keylogger](https://github.com/s3ntinel4/my-first-keylogger)

The first project in cybersecurity, the idea for the tool was to implement python code along with cybersecurity concepts, but, the main focus is to be educational purpose.

#### [Windows AD Installation Guide](https://github.com/s3ntinel4/WindowsADinstall)

Since the first time that i saw in high school, i always had the curiosity to know more about the tool but i had a hard time struggling with the initial steps, so i decided to create an installation guide to help others, it take some time but it was worth it.

#### [Email Analyzer](https://github.com/s3ntinel4/Email-Analyzer)

This email analyzer intergrate python with a VirusTotal API, an amazing tool that i also recommend to every security student to dive into, not only the web version but also the API.

#### [Cloud Projects](https://s3ntinel-docs.gitbook.io/aws-project)

As i am studying also cloud security, i decided to create an gitbook to document some projects, like the first one presented which is a Safe AWS VPC environment.
The mainly purpose is to document the projects in AWS, Azure and GCP infraestructure.

#### [EDR Home Lab](https://github.com/s3ntinel4/EDR-Home-Lab)

A EDR home lab project to simulate real cyber attacks by both attack and defense perspective, the idea came from the Eric's Capuano [blog](https://blog.ecapuano.com/p/so-you-want-to-be-a-soc-analyst-intro) post.
